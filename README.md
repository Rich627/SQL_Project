Welcome to my Car Factory Management System project! In this project, I developed a system using Java and MS SQL Server that can be utilized in a car factory or parking lot. This system allows for efficient management of vehicles, including features such as license plate tracking and pricing calculations based on parking duration.

## System Overview

The Car Factory Management System is designed to streamline the operations of a car factory or parking lot. It provides the following key features:

1. **License Plate Tracking:** The system includes a database table specifically for storing license plate information. This enables easy tracking and identification of vehicles within the facility.

2. **Time Tracking:** The system also incorporates a time table to record entry and exit timestamps for each vehicle. This data is crucial for calculating the duration of vehicle stays and determining the associated pricing.

3. **Pricing Calculation:** With the recorded time information, the system can automatically calculate the parking fees based on predefined pricing rules. This feature simplifies the billing process and ensures accurate and consistent pricing for the services provided.
