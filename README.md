## Parking Lot Management System

Our goal is to develop a parking lot management system that integrates with an MS SQL database using Java SDK. The system includes login functionality and a license plate query feature. We have created the necessary database tables and implemented Java randomization for license plate generation. The system also calculates fees based on specific criteria.

**Features:**

1. **Database Integration:** Connects seamlessly to an MS SQL database using Java SDK for efficient data management.

2. **License Plate Query:** Allows easy retrieval of license plate information.

3. **Database Table Creation:** Implements necessary tables for storing parking lot records, license plate details, and fee calculations.

4. **Random License Plate Generation:** Generates unique license plates using Java randomization techniques.

5. **Fee Calculation:** Calculates fees based on parking duration, vehicle type, and additional charges.

We aim to create a comprehensive parking lot management system that maximizes efficiency and user experience.
